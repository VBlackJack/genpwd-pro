## 📝 Beta Testing Guidelines

### Do's

✅ **Test regularly**: Aim for at least 2-3 sessions per week
✅ **Report all bugs**: No bug is too small. Even typos matter!
✅ **Be specific**: "It crashed" is not helpful. "It crashed when I clicked Generate after changing length to 128" is helpful.
✅ **Test edge cases**: Try to break things. Enter 999 characters. Generate 10,000 passwords.
✅ **Respect privacy**: Don't share screenshots with real passwords or personal data
✅ **Give constructive feedback**: "This UI is ugly" is not helpful. "The button is hard to see on dark mode" is helpful.

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't share beta builds**: Beta links are for testers only
❌ **Don't publish reviews yet**: Wait for public release
❌ **Don't use for production passwords**: Beta may have data loss bugs
❌ **Don't expect instant fixes**: We triage bugs by severity
❌ **Don't spam**: If you reported a bug, no need to report it again
