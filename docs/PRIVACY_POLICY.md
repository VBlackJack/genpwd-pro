**Effective Date**: 2025-11-15

- **Web Application**: https://vblackjack.github.io/genpwd-pro/
- **Browser Extensions**: Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons
- **Mobile Apps**: Android (Google Play Store)

## 1. Data Collection

### We Collect NO Data

GenPwd Pro does NOT collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information, including but not limited to:

- ❌ **Passwords**: Generated passwords are NEVER sent to our servers
- ❌ **Usage Analytics**: No tracking of how you use the app
- ❌ **Telemetry**: No crash reports, performance metrics, or diagnostics
- ❌ **Personal Information**: No name, email, phone number, or address
- ❌ **Device Information**: No device ID, IP address, or browser fingerprint
- ❌ **Location Data**: No GPS, Wi-Fi, or cell tower tracking
- ❌ **Cookies**: No tracking cookies (only essential session cookies for web app)
- ❌ **Third-Party Services**: No Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or similar

**Zero data collection. Period.**

---

## 2. Data Storage

All data generated by GenPwd Pro is stored **locally on your device**:

### Web Application
- **localStorage**: Saves settings (password length, complexity, theme)
- **IndexedDB**: Stores vault passwords (encrypted with AES-256-GCM)
- **sessionStorage**: Temporary data cleared when browser closes

### Browser Extensions
- **chrome.storage.local** / **browser.storage.local**: Extension settings
- **localStorage**: Vault passwords (encrypted)

### Android App
- **SharedPreferences**: App settings
- **Room Database**: Vault passwords (encrypted with SQLCipher)
- **DataStore**: User preferences

### CLI Tool
- **File System**: No persistent storage (passwords are only printed to console)

**Data stays on your device. We cannot access it even if we wanted to.**

---

## 3. Cloud Sync (Optional)

GenPwd Pro offers **optional** cloud sync for vault passwords:

### Supported Providers
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- OneDrive
- WebDAV
- pCloud

### How It Works
1. **You choose** to enable cloud sync
2. **You authenticate** directly with your cloud provider (OAuth2)
3. **We encrypt** your vault with AES-256-GCM + Argon2id
4. **We upload** the encrypted vault to YOUR cloud storage
5. **We NEVER** have access to your cloud credentials or decrypted data

### What We Store
- Nothing. The encrypted vault is stored in YOUR cloud storage account, not ours.

### What We Transmit
- Only encrypted vault data to/from YOUR cloud storage
- OAuth2 tokens are stored locally on your device
- All traffic is encrypted with HTTPS/TLS 1.3

**We are ZERO-KNOWLEDGE. Even if we were hacked, we cannot decrypt your data.**

## 4. Permissions

### Browser Extensions

**Chrome Extension** requests:
- `storage`: Save settings locally
- `activeTab`: Auto-fill passwords on current tab
- `clipboardWrite`: Copy passwords to clipboard
- `contextMenus`: Right-click menu integration
- `<all_urls>`: Auto-fill on any website (processed locally, never sent to us)

**Firefox Extension** requests:
- Same as Chrome, plus:
- `applications.gecko.id`: Unique extension identifier for Firefox

**Why we need these**: To provide core functionality (generate, copy, auto-fill). We do NOT abuse these permissions.

### Android App

**Permissions** requested:
- `INTERNET`: Only for optional cloud sync (can be disabled)
- `BIOMETRIC`: Fingerprint/Face unlock (optional)
- `CAMERA`: QR code scanning (optional)
- `VIBRATE`: Haptic feedback (optional)

**We do NOT request**:
- ❌ Phone calls or SMS
- ❌ Contacts
- ❌ Photos or media (except for QR scanning)
- ❌ Location
- ❌ Microphone

## 5. Third-Party Services

### We Use NO Third-Party Services

GenPwd Pro does NOT integrate with:
- ❌ Google Analytics
- ❌ Facebook SDK
- ❌ Crashlytics
- ❌ Firebase
- ❌ Sentry
- ❌ Mixpanel
- ❌ Hotjar
- ❌ Any advertising network

### Exception: Cloud Sync (Optional)

If you enable cloud sync, you interact directly with:
- Google Drive API (Google)
- Dropbox API (Dropbox)
- Microsoft Graph API (Microsoft)
- WebDAV servers (your chosen provider)
- pCloud API (pCloud)

**These providers have their own privacy policies**. We recommend reviewing them:
- [Google Drive Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [Dropbox Privacy Policy](https://www.dropbox.com/privacy)
- [Microsoft OneDrive Privacy Policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)

**We only use OAuth2 for authentication. We never see your cloud credentials.**

---

## 6. Security

### Encryption

**Vault Passwords** are encrypted with:
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Derivation**: Argon2id (memory-hard KDF)
- **Salt**: Unique 128-bit salt per vault
- **Iterations**: 2^15 (32,768) for Scrypt, 3 for Argon2id

**Cloud Sync** uses:
- **Transport**: HTTPS with TLS 1.3
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Vault is encrypted BEFORE upload

### Password Generation

**Cryptographically Secure** random number generation:
- **Web/Extensions**: `crypto.getRandomValues()` (Web Crypto API)
- **Android**: `SecureRandom` (Android Security Provider)
- **CLI**: `crypto.webcrypto.getRandomValues()` (Node.js)

**NOT secure**:
- ❌ `Math.random()` (JavaScript) - NEVER used
- ❌ `java.util.Random` (Java) - NEVER used

## 7. Children's Privacy

GenPwd Pro does not knowingly collect data from children under 13 (or applicable age in your jurisdiction).

**If you are under 13**, please do not use GenPwd Pro without parental supervision.

Since we collect NO data, we cannot violate COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) or similar laws.

---

## 8. International Data Transfers

**Not applicable.** GenPwd Pro does not transfer data internationally because we don't collect data.

If you use cloud sync, data is transferred to your chosen cloud provider (Google, Dropbox, Microsoft, etc.). Refer to their privacy policies for information on international transfers.

## 9. Your Rights

### Right to Access
- **Data we have**: None. We don't have any data about you.
